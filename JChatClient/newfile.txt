jhnphm: lalla
jhnphm: What are you drawing o_O?
Rim: just testing something
jhnphm: Ah
john: lalala
john: The 1px wide eraser sucks XD
john: But scrolling, etc works.
john: Need to optimize zoom next.
Jamu: Woo scroll thingy works *_*
john: Yah XD
Jamu: I was confused for a bit though XD I since the colors are reversed
john: XDD
Jamu: Make the bar the darker color and the BG lighter
john: It's a limitation of the theming though- if I make the bar dark, than the buttons get dark too, and then you can't read text.
Jamu: D:
Jamu: You can't change the button color separatey?
john: Nope, they're linked, unless I go dig up another theming engine.
Jamu: Also I like how pchat buttons are on a mobile menu
john: This is the best/smallest one I could fine though.
john: Mobile?
john: Didn't you say you hated that ? XDD
Jamu: You can move it around
Jamu: No, I don't like it on top of canvas
john: Ah.
Jamu: But I like being able tomove it within the margin
john: Nestor says he uses pro mode XD
john: Ah
john: What's the use there o-O?
john: (being able to move inside margin)
Jamu: Dunno I just like it XD for personal preference
Jamu: And also you can move it down if you open another menu like layers or coor
Jamu: color
john: Ah
john: I think I'm gonna tab tool preferences 
john: Like one tab for tool prefs, one tab for general options (which should be saved), one tab for tool picking.


Overwriting newer on top okay w/ undo. To implement undo, probably store layers underneath stroke bounding box before 

Setup tool to change layers

Fix server disconnect nullPointerexceptions

notify w/ liveconnect

notify of enter/exit w/ text

clean protocol for disconnect

persist settings

explicit copy/paste text

Line, erase, airbrush, dithering

Proper applet unload on close

Security. Should be safe, just verify login message, and strip textmessages of seedy chars.

Consider thread to perform scaling,.

Implement garbage collect/compress for tiles.

Perhaps add timestamp to messages

Gaussian dist for gradient
